Hello, world!
A few  useful commands to get started with vim.

Useful commands:

How to switch from insert mode to command mode: Esc
How to navigate up a line in command mode: k
How to navigate down a line in command mode: j
How to navigate left a character in command mode: h

How to exit without saving (in command mode): :q!Enter
How to Undo: u
How to Redo: Ctrl+r
You can combine writing and quitting (in command mode): :wqEnter
How to delete a line: D or its equivalent d$ will delete the rest of the line and leave you in command mode.
C or c$ will delete the rest of the line and put you in insert mode, and new text will be appended to the line.
How to skip to the end of the line: $ (dollar sign) key. You can use A to move to the end of the line and switch to editing mode (Append). To jump the last non-blank character, you can press g then _ keys.
The opposite of A is I (Insert mode at beginning of line), as an aside. Pressing just the ^ will place your cursor at the first non-white-space character of the line.
